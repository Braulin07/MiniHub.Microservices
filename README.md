# MiniHub.Microservices
MiniHub is an educational side project focused on learning real-world microservices architecture using .NET 8, Clean Architecture, JWT authentication, and an API Gateway. The system is composed of multiple independent microservices, each with its own database, deployed separately, and consumed by an Angular frontend.
